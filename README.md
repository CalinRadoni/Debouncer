# Helper component for button debouncing

This component uses a counting algorithm.
I think that it is more "safe" then other algorithms.

In the first implementation I have used a history based algorithm like the one described in [Embed With Elliot: Debounce Your Noisy Buttons, Part II](https://hackaday.com/2015/12/10/embed-with-elliot-debounce-your-noisy-buttons-part-ii/)

## Dependencies

[Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

## Development Environment

Main tools used where [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) and *ESP32 toolchain for Linux*
(see [Standard Setup of Toolchain for Linux](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/docs/get-started/linux-setup.rst)
for the latest version).
